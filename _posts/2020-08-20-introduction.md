title: Resources for finding biology Ph.D. projects in Australia
categories: [Miscellaneous]

So you want to do a Ph.D. in Australia in the biological sciences? What's available and who do I ask for more information? This site aims to streamline the process of liking students to potential projects and supervisors across Australia by organizing available information on one site.

[International students](/available-projects) are eligible to apply for Ph.D. projects as well, though in most cases they will have to secure fellowship funding either from their home country or from the host university. The latter path is typically highly competitive, and individual programs will provide more details about how fellowships are awarded and the application process required.
