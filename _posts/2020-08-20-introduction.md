So you want to do a Ph.D. in Australia in the ecology and evolution? What's available and who do I ask for more information? This site aims to streamline the process of linking students to potential projects and supervisors across Australia by organizing available information on one site. You can find links to university pages and relevant contact details on the [Available Projects](/available-projects) page.

Funding for domestic Ph.D. applicants with a first class honours is typically obtained through Commonwealth Funding, a process that is generally straightforward. [International students](/international-students) are also eligible to apply for Ph.D. projects, though in most cases they will have to secure fellowship funding either from their home country or from the host university. The latter path is typically highly competitive, and individual programs will provide more details about how fellowships are awarded and the application process required.
